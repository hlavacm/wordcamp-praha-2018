### Assely is a PHP framework which brings a little joy to the WordPress development. Develop structured, easily scalable and complex WordPress websites and web applications with true pleasure.

> Take a note this is a experimental project and we still in pre-alpha. Things may break, things may change :) Thanks for your understanding!

Today, WordPress development is pretty rough and messy. The Assely framework aims to introduce some standardized and comfortable ways for creating WordPress powered applications. We still have a long way to go, but we believe that it is possible. Take a look at what is waiting for you:

- Fast custom [Post Types](https://assely.org/docs/posttype), [Taxonomies](https://assely.org/docs/taxonomy), [Metaboxes](https://assely.org/docs/metabox) scaffolding
- Readable [Assets](https://assely.org/docs/asset) management
- Powerup [Menus](https://assely.org/docs/menu). No more crazy Walkers.
- [Sidebars](https://assely.org/docs/sidebar)
- Simple [Thumbnails](https://assely.org/docs/thumbnail) creation
- [Ajaxes](https://assely.org/docs/ajax)

...and even more features. Visit our comprehensive [documentation](https://assely.org/docs).
